OpenSCAD code for generating octahedra and tetrahedra, for illustrating a geometric proof of ∑i³

This includes the counterexample `octahedron-3.stl` proving that all points in certain overlapping octahedra don't all add to the same value, and the example `tetrahedron-5.stl` of all points in certain overlapping tetrahedra adding to the same value.
